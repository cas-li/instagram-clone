1. How to finetune font size / type / boldness for a cleaner, more visually appealing UI

## Notes

I took 1.5 sick days at the start of the week due to a medical emergency and also lost some time later in the week due to followup medical appointments. I was thus under time pressure to meet the MVP, but I'm glad that I was able to still meet the MVP and also get some stretch features done!
